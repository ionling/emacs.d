* Notes

** after-init-hook vs emacs-startup-hook

~after-init-hook~ is better for enabling ~ivy-mode~.

Here's why:

1. ~after-init-hook~ runs after all init files are loaded
   but before displaying the initial buffer. This is the standard place for enabling global modes.
2. ~emacs-startup-hook~ runs later, after command-line arguments are processed
   and the initial buffer is displayed. This delays mode activation unnecessarily.

For ~ivy-mode~, you want it ready as early as possible so commands like ~M-x~ work immediately.
Your current approach with ~:hook (after-init . ivy-mode)~ is correct.

The typical ordering is:

- ~after-init-hook~ → Enable global modes (~ivy-mode~, ~company-mode~, etc.)
- ~emacs-startup-hook~ → Run completion tasks, display messages
- ~window-setup-hook~ → Graphics-specific setup after frame is created
